# Data-Visualization-of-Alzheimer-s-Disease-Data-Set

Description of the dataset:
•	The dataset consists of a longitudinal MRI data of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96.
•	Each subject was scanned at least once.
•	Everyone is right-handed.
•	72 of the subjects were grouped as 'Nondemented' throughout the study.
•	64 of the subjects were grouped as 'Demented' at the time of their initial visits and remained so throughout the study.
•	14 subjects were grouped as 'Nondemented' at the time of their initial visit and were subsequently characterized as 'Demented' at a later visit. These fall under the 'Converted' category.

Objectives:
To perform exploratory data analysis and visualisation of the dataset contained in the csv file “oasis_longitudinal” .
This can be done by plotting different types of graphs ,heatmaps and pie charts comparing various attributes which are present in the dataset using various python libraries and modules like matplotlib,seaborn,pandas etc.
 
We will first see the overall distribution of categorical and numerical columns so that we can  drop the irrelevant attribute which has only 1 unique value throughout the dataset since it will not be helpful for the analysis.
